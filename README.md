# Practical-Tensorflow
These are notes and performance tips I discovered while building and deploying models in production. I am essentially going back to my physical notes and all the private repos (client work) to aggregate everything.

I will eventually turn these into blog-posts and put life into them by adding some examples. Until then, I encourage readers to make sense of this.
